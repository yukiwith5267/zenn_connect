### What is ML-Agents?

### Player Script
```cs
using UnityEngine;
using Unity.MLAgents;
using Unity.MLAgents.Actuators;
using Unity.MLAgents.Sensors;

// This is a public class called Player that inherits from another class called Agent
public class Player : Agent
{
    // These are public fields used to control the player's movement and tilt
    public float moveSpeed = 20f;
    public float rotSpeed = 100f;
    public float verticalForce = 17f;
    public float forwardTiltAmount = 0;
    public float sidewaysTiltAmount = 0;
    public float tiltVel = 2f;

    // These are private fields used for physics calculations and keeping track of checkpoints hit
    private Rigidbody playerRb;
    private float tiltAng = 45f;
    private int cptCount;

    // This method is called once when the agent is initialized. It finds the Rigidbody component on the game object.
    public override void Initialize()
    {
        playerRb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
    }

    // This method is called each time a new episode begins. It resets the player's position and velocity, as well as the checkpoint count.
    public override void OnEpisodeBegin()
    {
        cptCount = 0;
        transform.position = new Vector3(0, 10.0f, 0);
        transform.rotation = Quaternion.identity;
        playerRb.velocity = Vector3.zero;
        playerRb.angularVelocity = Vector3.zero;

        // Applies force to the player in the direction of (0, 200, 200) in global space.
        playerRb.AddForce(transform.TransformDirection(new Vector3(0, 200.0f, 200.0f)));
    }

    // This method is called whenever the player collides with a trigger collider.
    private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
    {
        // If the collider has the tag "Checkpoint", it awards a reward and increases the checkpoint count. If the count reaches 4, it ends the episode and awards more points.
        if (other.CompareTag("CheckPoint"))
        {
            AddReward(1.0f);
            cptCount++;

        {
            AddReward(-5.0f);
            EndEpisode();
        }
    }

    // This method is called each time the agent senses its environment, such as when the observation data is collected for the neural network.
    public override void CollectObservations(VectorSensor sensor)
    {
        sensor.AddObservation(playerRb.velocity);
        sensor.AddObservation(transform.rotation.eulerAngles);
    }

    // This method is called each time the agent receives an action from the neural network.
    public override void OnActionReceived(ActionBuffers actions)
    {
        // These are the continuous actions received in the buffer
        float horInput = actions.ContinuousActions[0];
        float verInput = actions.ContinuousActions[1];
        float upInput = actions.ContinuousActions[2];
        float downInput = actions.ContinuousActions[3];

        // Calculates and applies force to move the player based on the input values.
        Vector3 moveDirection = new Vector3(horInput, 0, verInput) * moveSpeed;
        playerRb.AddForce(transform.TransformDirection(moveDirection));

        // Applies upward or downward force to the player based on the input values.
        if (upInput > 0)
        {
            playerRb.AddForce(Vector3.up * verticalForce * upInput);
        }

        if (downInput > 0)
        {
            playerRb.AddForce(Vector3.down * verticalForce * downInput);
        }

        // Applies rotational force to the player based on the input values.
        transform.Rotate(0, rotInput * rotSpeed * Time.fixedDeltaTime, 0);

        // Applies forward and sideways tilt to the player based on the input values.
        sidewaysTiltAmount = Mathf.Lerp(sidewaysTiltAmount, -horInput * tiltAng, tiltVel * Time.fixedDeltaTime);

        Quaternion targetRot = Quaternion.Euler(forwardTiltAmount, 0, sidewaysTiltAmount);
        transform.localRotation = targetRot;
    }

    // This method is called during training when using a player-controlled agent. It maps user input to the action buffer.
    public override void Heuristic(in ActionBuffers actionsOut)
    {
        float horInput = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        float verInput = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
        float upInput = Input.GetKey(KeyCode.Space) ? 1 : 0;
        float downInput = Input.GetKey(KeyCode.LeftControl) ? 1 : 0;
        float rotInput = Input.GetAxis("Mouse X");

        ActionSegment<float> continuousAct = actionsOut.ContinuousActions;
        continuousAct[0] = horInput;
        continuousAct[1] = verInput;
        continuousAct[2] = upInput;
        continuousAct[3] = downInput;
        continuousAct[4] = rotInput;
    }
}
```

壁のTagを「Wall」、チェックポイントのTagを「CheckPoint」に設定します。
